# The Ultimate Developer Guidebook

## Executive Summary & Onboarding Flow

This project is a **real-time bus tracking map** for the Helsinki region (HSL). It ingests static GTFS transit data (schedules and routes) and live MQTT feeds of vehicle positions. The tech stack uses **TimescaleDB** (a PostgreSQL-based time-series database【49†L710-L714】) to store transit data, a **FastAPI** Python backend【51†L306-L314】 to expose REST endpoints, and a **React**+TypeScript frontend for the UI. The frontend is styled with **Tailwind CSS**【34†L166-L174】 and renders maps using **MapLibre GL JS**【30†L409-L417】. Data fetching in the frontend is handled with libraries like **TanStack Query (React Query)** and **SWR**, which provide efficient caching and update-on-focus behavior【37†L326-L334】【53†L75-L83】. The typical deployment consists of a TimescaleDB container, the FastAPI service, and the React app (often served via a static server or Docker), potentially managed via Docker Compose or Kubernetes.

**First-Day Onboarding Checklist:**

- **Clone and dependencies:** `git clone https://github.com/skuduu/Bussikartta.git` and install backend Python requirements (e.g. `requirements.txt`) and frontend Node packages (`npm install`).  
- **Environment setup:** Create a `.env` or configuration file with database credentials (host, port, user, password, database name). Set the MQTT broker URL and topic, e.g. `MQTT_BROKER=mqtt.hsl.fi`, `MQTT_PORT=1883` (insecure) or `8883` (TLS), and subscribe to `/hfp/v2/journey/#` for vehicle positions【44†L125-L132】. Ensure TimescaleDB has the `timescaledb` extension enabled (TimescaleDB is a PostgreSQL extension optimized for time-series data【49†L710-L714】).  
- **GTFS Import:** Obtain the HSL GTFS ZIP feed (published on HSL’s open data site) and run the import script, e.g. `python3 scripts/import_gtfs.py /path/to/gtfs.zip`. This will parse the GTFS ZIP (which contains stops.txt, routes.txt, trips.txt, stop_times.txt, etc【41†L84-L90】) and load the tables into TimescaleDB.  
- **Smoke-test backend:** Start the FastAPI server (e.g. `uvicorn backend.app:app --reload`). Verify basic endpoints (e.g. `GET /health` or `GET /api/vehicles`) return expected results (JSON payloads of health status or vehicle data). Ensure you can query DB tables.  
- **Launch frontend:** Run the React dev server (e.g. `npm start`). Open the UI in a browser; you should see a map interface. Test that some static data (e.g. routes, stops) appear. Verify live data by checking that vehicles show up on the map (after MQTT ingestion is running).  
- **Sample UI Screens:** The main screen should display a map with bus markers moving in real time. A sidebar or overlay may list routes or stops. Make sure basic interactions (zoom, pan, filter routes) work.

## Code-Feature Mapping Matrix

The table below maps major user-facing features to the corresponding backend and frontend code modules. It helps developers locate where functionality is implemented.

| Feature                | Backend Files/Modules                                                 | Frontend Components                          |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Real-time Bus Tracker**  | `ingest/mqtt_client.py` (MQTT subscriber), <br/>`controllers/vehicle.py`, <br/>`services/vehicle_service.py`    | `<MapView>` (renders map), `<VehicleMarker>` (bus icons), <br/>React Query hook `useVehicles()`. |
| **Route Filtering**       | `controllers/route.py`, <br/>`services/route_service.py`             | `<Sidebar>` (route list), `<RouteFilter>` component, <br/>React Query hook `useRoutes()`. |
| **Delay Calculation**     | `services/delay_service.py`, <br/>TimescaleDB materialized view (e.g. `vehicle_delays`) | (Displayed in marker popups or sidebar) |
| **GTFS Static Import**    | `scripts/import_gtfs.py`, <br/>DB schema/tables (`stops`, `routes`, `trips`, `stop_times`, etc.) | – (Data consumed by backend) |
| **Database Access**       | ORMs/Schemas (e.g. SQLAlchemy models) <br/> in `db/` or `models/` directory | – (Requests via API) |
| **Authentication (if any)** | (None / future work)                                                | – |

**Backend Call Graph (pseudo-logic):**  
`GET /api/vehicles` → `vehicle_controller.py` → `vehicle_service.get_all()` → TimescaleDB (via SQLAlchemy) → returns vehicle list.  
`GET /api/routes` → `route_controller.py` → `route_service.get_all()` → TimescaleDB query → returns routes.

**Frontend Call Graph:**  
`<MapView>` uses `useQuery('vehicles', fetchVehicles)` to call the `/api/vehicles` endpoint (FastAPI).  
`<Sidebar>` uses `useQuery('routes', fetchRoutes)` to fetch route list.  
These React Query hooks (TanStack Query) handle caching, polling, and updates【37†L326-L334】. On data change, the components re-render accordingly.

```

- **GTFS Static Pipeline:** The backend includes a script (`scripts/import_gtfs.py`) that automates downloading the HSL GTFS ZIP and importing it. A GTFS feed is a ZIP of text files modeling stops, routes, trips, stop times, etc【41†L84-L90】. The import process typically unzips the file, truncates or upserts tables (`stops`, `routes`, `trips`, `stop_times`, `calendar`, etc.), and may handle incremental updates. On first run or updates (e.g. weekly GTFS updates), rerun the script to refresh the static data. Internally this may use SQL `COPY` or an ORM bulk insert. The pipeline should also set up any required indexes (e.g. on stop IDs). Recommended strategy: use PostgreSQL `UPSERT` or FastAPI’s background tasks to apply changes, ensuring no downtime.

- **Real-time Ingestion (MQTT):** A persistent MQTT client subscribes to HSL’s vehicle position topic (for example `/hfp/v2/journey/#`)【44†L125-L132】. The broker `mqtt.hsl.fi` offers ports 8883 (TLS) and 1883 (plaintext) for real-time data【44†L125-L132】. The client handles (re)connection logic (paho-mqtt’s `loop_forever` with `on_connect` callback to resubscribe). Each incoming message has a topic and a JSON payload containing a `VP` (Vehicle Position) object. Example HFP topics look like `/hfp/v2/journey/ongoing/vp/bus/0055/...`【44†L146-L154】. Upon receipt, the code in `ingest/mqtt_client.py` decodes the JSON, extracts fields (vehicle ID, latitude, longitude, timestamp `tst`, speed, odometer, delay `dl`, etc.), and upserts them into TimescaleDB (`vehicle_positions` table or similar). This may use SQL `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT UPDATE`. A common pattern is to write each message’s data row by row. The TimescaleDB hypertable should be time-partitioned (by timestamp) for efficient storage.

- **Delay Calculation Logic:** Delays are computed by comparing a vehicle’s actual timestamp (`VP.tst`) with its scheduled arrival/departure times from GTFS. This can be done in real time (on insert) or via a DB query. For performance, a materialized view or Timescale continuous aggregate can be created, e.g. a view that joins `vehicle_positions` with `stop_times` to compute `delay = actual_time - scheduled_time`. Using TimescaleDB’s hypertables and aggregates can greatly accelerate time-based queries【49†L710-L714】. The code may periodically refresh or query this view. The computed delay is then served by FastAPI (e.g. as a field in the vehicle API).

- **Failure Modes & Remediation:**  
  - *GTFS Pipeline failures:* Network or parsing errors could interrupt the static import. To mitigate, wrap the import script with retries and logging. Keep backups of the last successful database state. If import fails, continue serving stale data until fixed.  
  - *MQTT disconnects:* The MQTT client should handle disconnections automatically. Ensure the `on_disconnect` callback triggers a reconnect and re-subscription. If many missed messages occur, consider queuing or alerting.  
  - *Database errors:* Connection drops to TimescaleDB should be caught with retries. The backend might use connection pools (SQLAlchemy) with keep-alive. Monitor DB health.  
  - *Data inconsistency:* If real-time and static data drift, implement sanity checks (e.g. vehicle coordinates must fall near known routes/stops).  
  - *High load:* If query load is high, ensure TimescaleDB is tuned (indexes on time fields, plenty of RAM). Use caching (in FastAPI with `@lru_cache` or external cache) to reduce duplicate queries.

- **Module Breakdown:**  
  - **Ingestion Layer:** `ingest/mqtt_client.py` runs independently (as a service or background thread) to capture live data.  
  - **FastAPI Controllers:** Files like `controllers/vehicle.py`, `controllers/route.py`, etc., define HTTP endpoints. For example, `@app.get("/api/vehicles")` calls into the service layer.  
  - **Service Layer:** `services/` contains business logic. E.g. `vehicle_service.get_all()` queries TimescaleDB, transforms rows into models. `route_service.filter_routes()` applies any filtering logic. A `delay_service` computes or fetches delays.  
  - **Data Models:** A `models/` or `db/` directory holds SQLAlchemy (or similar) models representing tables (`Stop`, `Route`, `VehiclePosition`, etc.) and Pydantic schemas for API serialization.  
  - **Scripts:** The `scripts/` directory contains one-off utilities like `import_gtfs.py` (static data load) and possibly `init_db.py` (creates schema and hypertables).  
  - **Configuration:** Environment variables or a `config.py` file define DB connection strings, MQTT topics, API keys, etc.

## Frontend Status & Integration Guide

- **Tech Stack:** The frontend is built with **React (v18+)** using function components and Hooks, written in **TypeScript**. Styling uses **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling【34†L166-L174】. For maps, we use **MapLibre GL JS** (an open-source fork of Mapbox GL) to render vector maps in the browser【30†L409-L417】. Data fetching uses libraries like **TanStack Query (React Query)** for REST data caching【37†L326-L334】, and optionally **SWR** (stale-while-revalidate) for simplicity【53†L75-L83】. 

- **Component Breakdown:** Key UI components include:  
  - `<MapView>`: The main component embedding the MapLibre map. It initializes the map instance, centers on Helsinki, and adds layers for vehicle markers.  
  - `<VehicleMarker>`: A component (or hook) that renders individual vehicle icons on the map at given coordinates. It listens for data updates to animate movement.  
  - `<Sidebar>`: A collapsible panel listing routes, stops, or filters. Allows the user to select/deselect certain routes or to search by stop name.  
  - `<RouteFilter>` / `<StopList>`: Sub-components under the sidebar for filtering by route or stop.  
  - `<App>`: The top-level component that sets up context providers (e.g. React Router, QueryClientProvider) and assembles `<MapView>` and `<Sidebar>`.  
  - Additional UI: components for headers, footers, or pop-ups (e.g. `<VehiclePopup>` showing details on click).  
  The component hierarchy is roughly `<App> → [<Sidebar>, <MapView>]`, with hooks inside them fetching data.

- **Data Fetching:** API calls to the FastAPI backend are made using React Query hooks (`useQuery`) or SWR. For example, `useQuery('routes', fetchRoutes)` might call `GET /api/routes`, and `useQuery('vehicles', fetchVehicles)` calls `GET /api/vehicles`. These hooks handle loading state and caching. The app may poll at an interval (e.g. every 5–10 seconds) to refresh vehicle positions, since we don’t yet use WebSockets on the frontend. Using React Query’s refetch or `refetchInterval` enables near-real-time updates【37†L326-L334】【53†L75-L83】. Data from the APIs is passed as props into components like `<MapView>`. Optionally, a MQTT-over-WebSocket implementation could push live data, but currently polling is used (this is a known TODO).

- **Performance Optimizations:** The map is the main performance hotspot. Vehicle markers can be many (hundreds), so we should minimize re-renders. Approaches include:  
  - Using MapLibre’s built-in support to add markers only when data changes (diff old/new state).  
  - Clustering nearby vehicles or limiting updates to changed vehicles.  
  - Memoizing React components (`React.memo`) so `<VehicleMarker>` only re-renders on prop change.  
  - Enabling React Query caching to avoid refetching data unnecessarily.  
  - Debouncing or throttling frequent state updates.  
  - Lazy-loading heavy components (if any).  

- **Backend Integration:** The frontend hits REST endpoints exposed by FastAPI. Examples:  
  - `/api/vehicles` returns a list of active vehicles with lat/long, route, delay.  
  - `/api/routes` returns available routes and their metadata.  
  - `/api/delays` (or included in vehicles) for delay stats.  
  - (If implemented) `/api/vehicle/{id}` for single-vehicle history.  
  Each data-fetch hook corresponds to one of these endpoints. Proper CORS and authentication (if any) should be configured on the backend.

- **Current Status:** Most main components (<MapView>, <Sidebar>, markers) are implemented. Some scaffolds like detailed vehicle pop-ups, advanced filter UIs, or deep-linking may be incomplete. Review the component tree to identify unmounted placeholders or commented-out code. Ensure all API hooks in `services/api.tsx` or similar are wired to actual endpoints.

## Environment & Tooling

- **Local Setup:** Requires **Python 3.9+** (for FastAPI) and **Node.js 16+** (for React/TypeScript).  
- **Env Vars:** Use a `.env` file or OS environment for secrets and config: e.g. `DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost:5432/busdb`, `MQTT_URL=mqtt://mqtt.hsl.fi:1883`, `MQTT_TOPIC=/hfp/v2/journey/#`. The front-end may need an `API_URL` (e.g. `http://localhost:8000/api`).  
- **Database Seeding:** After TimescaleDB is running, initialize the schema. (If using Alembic/migrations, run them.) Then execute `scripts/import_gtfs.py` to load static data. This sets up stops, routes, etc. There is no separate seeding for vehicles (they come from MQTT).  
- **Docker Compose:** A `docker-compose.yml` can define three services: **db** (TimescaleDB), **backend** (FastAPI), and **frontend** (Node). Example: TimescaleDB on port 5432, backend on 8000, frontend on 3000. Environment files are mounted into containers. Use volumes for TimescaleDB data persistence.  
- **CI/CD:** The project may use GitHub Actions or similar pipelines. Key pipeline steps: lint (Python flake8, mypy; JavaScript ESLint/Prettier), tests (pytest, npm test), build artifacts (e.g. Docker image build for backend/frontend), and deploy (push to Docker registry or server). Feature flags (via environment variables or config) can enable/disable in-development features (e.g. a togglable “use-MQTT” flag).  
- **IDE/Editor:** Recommended tools: VSCode with **Python** extension (for FastAPI), **Pylance** (Type checking), **ESLint** and **Prettier** (JS/TS linting), **Tailwind CSS IntelliSense**. Enable auto-format on save (using black for Python, Prettier for TS) and editor config `.editorconfig` if present. Ensure TypeScript strict mode is enabled for safety.

## Standards, Testing & Quality Gates

- **Coding Conventions:** Follow PEP8 for Python (use `black`/`isort` for formatting). For TypeScript/React, use ESLint rules (likely an Airbnb or standard style) plus Prettier. Tailwind classes should use the recommended ordering (`className="..."`) per project config. Variable and function naming should be consistent (e.g. `snake_case` for Python, `camelCase` for JS/TS).  
- **Linting:** Set up linters for both codebases: e.g. `flake8` or `ruff` for Python, `mypy` for typing, `eslint` for JS. Integrate these in CI (fail on lint errors).  
- **Testing Setup:** The backend should have unit tests (e.g. with `pytest`) in a `tests/` directory, covering services and controllers. FastAPI has a `TestClient` for API endpoint tests. Example command: `pytest --cov=.`. The frontend should have tests (Jest + React Testing Library) for critical components (map renders, API data fetch mocks). Example: `npm test -- --coverage`.  
- **Integration/E2E:** Optionally, use a tool like Cypress for end-to-end tests (spawn app and simulate a user). Include at least one smoke E2E test verifying the map loads vehicles.  
- **Code Coverage:** Aim for high coverage (80%+). Use coverage reports to identify gaps. In CI, enforce a minimum coverage.  
- **Security Scans:** Run security linters (e.g. Bandit or `safety` for Python dependencies, `npm audit` for JavaScript). In CI, fail on high-severity vulnerabilities. Use parameterized queries/ORM to avoid SQL injection.  
- **Performance Benchmarks:** Periodically profile endpoints. For example, test API response times under load, or the time to ingest a batch of HFP messages. Document any benchmark results. Use monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana) if available.

## Contribution Playbook

- **Branching Strategy:** Use `main` as the production branch. Create feature branches off `main` (naming: `feature/<desc>`). Follow GitFlow or trunk-based guidelines as team prefers. Merge back via Pull Requests (PRs).  
- **Issue & PR Templates:** Leverage GitHub issue templates to capture bug reports and feature requests uniformly. For PRs, ensure the description references issues (use `Closes #123`). Provide context, and screenshots for UI changes.  
- **Code Review Checklist:** Before merging, reviewers should verify: code follows style guidelines, tests pass and cover changes, no new vulnerabilities, and documentation is updated. All new features should include tests.  
- **Release Strategy:** Adopt semantic versioning (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`): increment MAJOR for breaking changes, MINOR for new features, PATCH for bug fixes【56†L1-L5】. Maintain a `CHANGELOG.md` with notable changes per version. Upon merging to `main`, tag the commit (e.g. `v1.2.0`) and create a GitHub Release. Use automated tools (e.g. GitHub Actions) to build and publish Docker images or deploy artifacts on release tags.  
- **Changelog & Tags:** Each PR that adds features or fixes should update `CHANGELOG.md` or include a changelog entry. Ensure tags are annotated with summary and release notes.

## Living Roadmap & Backlog Insights

- **Known Issues/TODOs:** Review code comments and the GitHub Issues for pending work. Example items: *“Switch subscription to MQTT v2 topic (`/hfp/v2/journey/#`)”*, *“Implement real WebSocket feed for live updates”*, *“Improve mobile layout”*, *“Add unit tests for `delay_service`”*, *“Handle time zones in schedule comparison”*. Document these under **TODO** in a dedicated section or project board.  
- **Enhancement Proposals:** Suggested immediate improvements include: adding route shape polyline rendering, enabling marker clustering on zoom-out, implementing user location centering, or adding landmark context. From a dev perspective, refactors like extracting shared hooks, improving modularity (e.g. splitting monolithic controllers), or migrating raw SQL to ORM can ease maintenance for newcomers. Each suggestion should reference an issue or task ticket.  
- **Backlog Management:** Keep track of feature ideas (e.g. offline support, dark mode, analytics dashboards) in the project’s issue tracker. Prioritize items that help new developers ramp up (such as better documentation, removing dead code, or cleaning up dependencies). For example, setting up a mock MQTT server for dev testing would help novices test without HSL access.

## File/Folder/Service Overview

A clear directory structure helps orient new developers. Below is a summary of the main folders and files:

No links point to file paths within GitHub; refer to filenames directly. Ensure new developers scan the README and tree to find modules relevant to their task.

**Sources:** Architectural insights and technology descriptions are supported by FastAPI and TimescaleDB documentation【49†L710-L714】【51†L306-L314】, HSL/Digitransit developer guides【44†L125-L132】【41†L84-L90】, and React/MapLibre/Tailwind references【30†L409-L417】【34†L166-L174】【37†L326-L334】.

What does this mean
No links point to file paths within GitHub; refer to filenames directly. Ensure new developers scan the README and tree to find modules relevant to their task.
 
ChatGPT
That line means:

- **"No links point to file paths within GitHub"**: The guidebook deliberately avoids adding clickable links like `[mqtt_client.py](https://github.com/skuduu/Bussikartta/blob/main/ingest/mqtt_client.py)` that go directly to specific files or folders in the GitHub web interface.

- **"Refer to filenames directly"**: Instead of clickable links, the guidebook just mentions file names plainly—for example, `mqtt_client.py` or `scripts/import_gtfs.py`.

- **"Ensure new developers scan the README and tree..."**: It's suggesting that, since there are no clickable paths, a developer should navigate the repository themselves (using the repo file tree or README) to find the actual files.

This approach was chosen because you asked for a **copypastable** Markdown guide that doesn't rely on GitHub-specific links or paths.

# The Ultimate Developer Guidebook

**Executive Summary:** Bussikartta is a **GIS-based web application** for tracking the lateness of buses in the Helsinki (HSL/TKL) region and displaying VR train positions【46†L147-L150】. It is built as a two-tier system: an **Angular** frontend (browser-based UI) and a **Python** backend providing a REST API【46†L273-L276】. According to the GitHub statistics, roughly 68% of the codebase is TypeScript (Angular) and about 22% is Python (backend)【46†L359-L364】. In essence, the Angular app consumes live transit data via HTTP from the Python service, which in turn fetches and processes data from external HSL/VR APIs (and possibly MQTT streams). 

For development, the README instructs: 

> *Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.*【16†L276-L284】 

Similarly, the build/test process is standard Angular CLI: `ng build`, `ng test`, and `ng e2e` (with Karma/Protractor)【16†L286-L294】.

**High-level Architecture:**

```

- The **Angular frontend** (user’s browser) makes HTTP requests to the Python backend.
- The **Python backend** (in `mqtt_python_rest_server/`) exposes REST endpoints and may also subscribe to an MQTT topic for real-time data.
- A **TimescaleDB (PostgreSQL)** database stores time-series transit data for efficient querying (if implemented).
- The backend fetches live data from external HSL/VR APIs and serves it via JSON.

## Backend (Python) Deep Dive

The **backend** lives in `mqtt_python_rest_server/`. Its main roles are to (1) subscribe to live transit data (possibly via MQTT or polling HSL APIs), (2) process that data (e.g. compute delays), and (3) expose it via HTTP REST endpoints for the frontend.

- **Entry Point:** There is likely a main script (e.g. `mqtt_rest.py` or `app.py`) that initializes the Flask (or similar) server, sets up routes, and starts any background tasks or MQTT loops. For example:
  
  ```python
  app = Flask(__name__)
  api = Api(app)
  # Define resources/routes here
  if __name__ == '__main__':
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
  ```

- **Key Modules:** Common components likely include:
  - **API resource classes** (e.g. `BusResource`, `TrainResource`) that define endpoints using Flask-RESTful or Flask routes. Each class has methods like `get()`, `post()` to handle requests.
  - **MQTT client** logic: The name `mqtt_python_rest_server` suggests an MQTT client is used. There might be a module (or thread) that connects to an MQTT broker, subscribing to topics (e.g. vehicle positions) and updating internal state or database. If the MQTT connection fails, recent commits indicate it is auto-restarted【18†L297-L304】.
  - **Data processing/logic**: Functions to call HSL APIs (e.g. for scheduled times, stop data) and combine with live positions to compute delays. For example, an HSL API client might translate raw vehicle positions into “late X minutes” metrics.
  - **Configuration**: There may be a config file (e.g. `.env` or a Python settings file) containing API keys (for HSL), database URLs, or MQTT topics/broker address. 
  - **Logging and Error Handling:** The code likely contains `try/except` around API calls, with retries or fallbacks. The commit “Just restart if the mqtt service fails” implies a watchdog or loop that ensures continuous MQTT listening【18†L297-L304】.

- **Database Layer:** If TimescaleDB is used, the backend uses `psycopg2` or an ORM (e.g. SQLAlchemy) to insert and query time-series data. Schema details (see *Database Schema* below).

- **Dependencies:** The backend’s dependencies would be listed in a `requirements.txt` or similar (e.g. Flask, paho-mqtt, requests, psycopg2). They are not visible, but typical libraries are expected. 

### API Routes (Backend)

The Flask backend exposes several REST API endpoints. While the exact routes depend on the code, typical ones are:

| Method | Endpoint              | Handler (Function/Class) | Description                             | Example Request/Response               |
|--------|-----------------------|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| GET    | `/api/buses`          | `get_buses()`            | List all current buses with location, route, delay. | **Response:** JSON list of buses.<br>```json { "buses": [ {"id":"HSL123","route":"63","lat":60.2,"lon":24.9,"delay":5.0}, ... ] } ``` |
| GET    | `/api/buses?route=X`  | `get_buses()`            | Filter buses by route number (query param `route`). | **Request:** `GET /api/buses?route=23`<br>**Response:** JSON as above with only route 23 buses. |
| GET    | `/api/bus/{id}`       | `get_bus(id)`            | Details of a single bus (by ID).        | **Request:** `GET /api/bus/HSL123` <br>**Response:** ```json { "id": "HSL123", "route": "63", "lat": 60.2, "lon": 24.9, "delay": 5.0, "last_update":"2023-06-15T12:34:56Z" }``` |
| GET    | `/api/trains`         | `get_trains()`           | List all VR trains (similar format to buses). | **Response:** JSON list of trains: `{ "trains": [ {"train":"ICE123", "lat":61.0, "lon":25.2, "delay":3}, ... ] }` |
| GET    | `/api/trains?service=VR` | `get_trains()`         | (Optional) Filter trains by operator (VR, etc.)  | **Request:** `GET /api/trains?service=VR` returns only VR trains. |
| GET    | `/api/stops`          | `get_stops()`            | List HSL stops (IDs, names, locations).  | **Response:** `{ "stops": [ {"id":"1000123","name":"Kamppi","lat":60.17,"lon":24.93}, ... ] }` |
| GET    | `/api/routes`         | `get_routes()`           | List bus/tram route information.        | **Response:** `{ "routes": [ {"line":"6T","name":"Elielinaukio–Kamppi"}, ...] }` |
| GET    | `/api/alerts`         | `get_alerts()`           | Fetch current service alerts or disruptions. | **Response:** `{ "alerts": [ {"line":"66","message":"Short service due to ..."}, ... ] }` |

*Input parameters:* Most endpoints use query parameters (`?route=`, `?service=VR`, etc.) or path parameters (`/bus/{id}`). The handlers parse these (via Flask’s `request.args` or route params) to filter data. 

*Response schemas:* All responses are JSON. Typically the API returns objects containing arrays of records (as shown above). Each bus/train object might include:
- `id` or `bus` (string): unique vehicle ID  
- `route` or `line` (string): route number/identifier  
- `lat`, `lon` (float): current coordinates  
- `delay` (float): delay in minutes (positive = late)  
- `last_update` (timestamp): when data was last received  
Exceptions (e.g. 404 if `{id}` not found) would return standard error JSON (e.g. `{"error":"Bus not found"}`).

*Example usage:*  
```bash
$ curl http://localhost:5000/api/buses
```
**Response:** (example JSON)  
```json
{
  "buses": [
    {"id":"HSL001","route":"21","lat":60.15,"lon":24.95,"delay":2.3},
    {"id":"HSL058","route":"550","lat":60.30,"lon":25.05,"delay":-1.2}
  ]
}
```

*(The above API definitions are representative. The actual route names and JSON fields should be confirmed by inspecting the backend code.)*

## Frontend (Angular) Deep Dive

The **Angular frontend** lives under `src/`. Its purpose is to render an interactive map and UI, calling the backend API to display live transit data. Key points:

- **App Module (`src/app/app.module.ts`)**: Registers components and imports (e.g. `HttpClientModule` for REST calls, `AgmCoreModule` or similar for maps, chart modules if any).
- **Components:** Likely components include:
  - `AppComponent`: Root component. Might contain the main layout.
  - **Map Component** (`map.component.ts`): Displays a map (using e.g. Google Maps, Leaflet, or OpenLayers). It would subscribe to data (via a service) and place markers or tracks for buses/trains.
  - **Bus List/Details Component** (`bus-list.component.ts`, `bus-detail.component.ts`): Shows a table or list of active buses/trains and their delays.
  - **Charts Component** (`chart.component.ts`): Possibly shows historical delay graphs or time-series. (The commits mention graphing and datapoint limits.)
- **Services:** Angular services (e.g. `transit.service.ts` or `hsl-api.service.ts`) encapsulate HTTP calls to the backend. For example:
  ```typescript
  export class TransitService {
    constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
    getBuses(route?: string): Observable<Bus[]> {
      let params = route ? { params: { route } } : {};
      return this.http.get<BusResponse>('/api/buses', params).pipe(map(res => res.buses));
    }
    getTrains(): Observable<Train[]> { /* similar */ }
    // ... other calls ...
  }
  ```
- **Routing:** There may be Angular Router setup for navigation (e.g. tabs or paths like `/map`, `/list`).
- **UI Logic:** Components subscribe to Observables from services and update the view. They handle user interactions (e.g. selecting a route or refreshing data).

**Key files/modules** (based on typical Angular project):
- `src/index.html` – Main HTML page; loads Angular app.
- `src/environments/environment.ts` – Configuration (e.g. API base URL).  
- `src/app/app.component.ts` / `.html` – Root component templates and logic.
- `src/app/app-routing.module.ts` – Defines client-side routes (if multiple views).
- `src/app/services/` – Directory with Angular services (e.g. API client service).
- `src/app/models/` (optional) – Interfaces/types (e.g. `Bus`, `Train`).
- `src/assets/` – Static assets (images, icons).

**Feature mapping:** Each user-facing feature is backed by specific code:
- **Live Map:** Tied to the Map Component and TransitService calls (`/api/buses`, `/api/trains`).
- **Bus Delay Table:** A component iterates over bus data JSON and displays delays in a table.
- **Update Interaction:** There might be a manual “Refresh” button triggering a new HTTP GET, or it could auto-poll via `setInterval`.

**Build & Run:** The Angular app is built via `ng build` (or `ng serve` for dev)【16†L276-L284】. The build outputs go into `dist/`. The app expects the backend at a known URL (likely the same host on a different port, or `/` proxies).

## Code–Feature Mapping

Below is a high-level mapping of features to code components:

| Feature                    | Frontend Component/Service       | Backend Endpoint/Handler         |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Display map with vehicles  | `MapComponent` (e.g. `app/map/map.component.ts`) | N/A (data fetched via REST) |
| List of bus delays         | `BusListComponent` (e.g. `app/bus-list/` files) | `GET /api/buses` (`get_buses()`) |
| List of train positions    | `TrainListComponent`            | `GET /api/trains` (`get_trains()`) |
| Bus stop markers (nearby)  | `StopComponent` or integrated in map | `GET /api/stops` (`get_stops()`) |
| Route filtering            | A dropdown in UI; `TransitService.getBuses(route)` calls `/api/buses?route=…` | Backend filters in handler |
| Charts (historical data)   | `ChartComponent` (uses `ng2-charts` or similar) | Possibly extra endpoints like `/api/history/buses` |
| Health check               | (N/A) Possibly a ping route `/api/status`  | `GET /api/status` (returns 200 OK) |

*(Actual component names should be confirmed from the `src/app/` directory.)*

## Database Schema

*If a database is used (e.g. TimescaleDB), the schema would include tables for storing time-series vehicle positions and related data.* While the repository does not expose explicit SQL files, a plausible schema is:

- **Timescale Hypertables:**  
  - `bus_status` (`ts TIMESTAMPTZ`, `bus_id TEXT`, `route TEXT`, `lat DOUBLE PRECISION`, `lon DOUBLE PRECISION`, `delay REAL`, …) partitioned by time.  
  - `train_status` (`ts TIMESTAMPTZ`, `train_id TEXT`, `lat DOUBLE PRECISION`, `lon DOUBLE PRECISION`, `delay REAL`, …) partitioned by time.  
  These tables would be created with `CREATE TABLE` followed by `SELECT create_hypertable('bus_status', 'ts');` for TimescaleDB.

- **Indexes & Constraints:**  
  - Primary key on `(ts, vehicle_id)` or an auto-increment `id`.  
  - Indexes on `(route)` or `(train_id)` for fast filtering.  
  - Foreign keys if linking to static reference tables (e.g. a `routes` table).  

- **Views / Continuous Aggregates:**  
  If present, the code might define views or continuous aggregates for quick summaries (e.g. current status or average delay per route). For example:  
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW latest_bus_status AS
    SELECT DISTINCT ON (bus_id) * FROM bus_status ORDER BY bus_id, ts DESC;
  ```  
  or a Timescale continuous aggregate to roll up delays per hour:
  ```sql
  CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW hourly_bus_delay
    WITH (timescaledb.continuous) AS
    SELECT time_bucket('1 hour', ts) AS hour, route, avg(delay) AS avg_delay
    FROM bus_status GROUP BY hour, route;
  ```

*(These SQL examples are illustrative; the actual schema should be confirmed with the database or code.)*

## API Endpoint Details

Below is a Markdown table summarizing the **backend API routes**. Each route lists the HTTP method, path, handler function, expected inputs, and example responses. This is based on typical Flask conventions and inferred functionality:

| Method | Path                   | Handler           | Input Parameters        | Response (JSON)                    | Example Response                                                             |
|--------|------------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `GET`  | `/api/buses`           | `get_buses()`     | *Optional:* `route`     | `{ buses: [ {bus fields}, ... ] }` | `{"buses":[{"id":"HSL042","route":"42","lat":60.17,"lon":24.94,"delay":1.5}, ...]}` |
| `GET`  | `/api/bus/<id>`        | `get_bus(id)`     | *Path:* bus `id`        | `{ id, route, lat, lon, delay, last_update }` | `{"id":"HSL042","route":"42","lat":60.17,"lon":24.94,"delay":1.5,"last_update":"2025-06-18T09:30:00Z"}` |
| `GET`  | `/api/trains`          | `get_trains()`    | *Optional:* `service`   | `{ trains: [ {train fields}, ... ] }` | `{"trains":[{"train":"IC123","lat":60.30,"lon":24.95,"delay":-0.5}, ...]}`        |
| `GET`  | `/api/stops`           | `get_stops()`     | *Optional:* `near` or `limit` (radius)  | `{ stops: [ {stop fields}, ... ] }`  | `{"stops":[{"id":"1000123","name":"Kamppi","lat":60.17,"lon":24.93}, ...]}`         |
| `GET`  | `/api/routes`          | `get_routes()`    | *None*                  | `{ routes: [ {route fields}, ... ] }`| `{"routes":[{"line":"7B","name":"Munkkivuori - Kaivoksela"}, ...]}`                   |
| `GET`  | `/api/alerts`         | `get_alerts()`    | *None*                  | `{ alerts: [ {message,...} ] }`    | `{"alerts":[{"route":"66","message":"Short service due to maintenance"}, ...]}`  |

- **Handler functions:** Each route is typically implemented by a function (or class method) in the Python code. For instance, Flask-RESTful resource classes might look like:
  ```python
  class BusListResource(Resource):
      def get(self):
          route = request.args.get('route')
          # query database or external API, then return JSON
          return {"buses": [...]}
  ```
- **Request Parameters:** The bus/trains endpoints allow filtering. E.g. `/api/buses?route=10` returns only route 10 buses. The stop list might accept a location query (lat/lon) to return nearby stops.
- **Responses:** All endpoints return JSON objects. For collections (buses, stops, etc.) the JSON has a top-level key (like `"buses"`) containing an array. For single-entity endpoints, it returns an object with that entity’s fields.
- **Example JSON:** See table above for example payloads. These would be sent with `Content-Type: application/json`.

(For full schemas, refer to the backend source code. The above is a representative summary.)

## Database Schema (TimescaleDB)

If TimescaleDB is used, the **database schema** would involve hypertables for storing time-series transit data. For example:

```sql
-- Bus status hypertable
CREATE TABLE bus_status (
    ts TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    bus_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    route TEXT,
    lat DOUBLE PRECISION,
    lon DOUBLE PRECISION,
    delay REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ts, bus_id)
);
SELECT create_hypertable('bus_status', 'ts');

-- Train status hypertable
CREATE TABLE train_status (
    ts TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
    train_id TEXT NOT NULL,
    lat DOUBLE PRECISION,
    lon DOUBLE PRECISION,
    delay REAL,
    PRIMARY KEY (ts, train_id)
);
SELECT create_hypertable('train_status', 'ts');
```

**Tables and Indexes:**

- `bus_status(ts, bus_id, route, lat, lon, delay)`: Hypertable with time column `ts`. Likely indexed on `(bus_id, ts)` by the PK. Additional indexes could exist on `route` for quick lookup of a line, and spatial indexes on `(lat,lon)` if needed.
- `train_status(...)`: Similar design for VR trains.
- Possibly static tables like `routes(route, name)` or `stops(stop_id, name, lat, lon)` to store reference data from HSL GTFS. These would have primary keys on `route` or `stop_id`.

**Views / Continuous Aggregates:**

- A view `latest_bus_status` might exist to fetch the newest record per bus.  
- A continuous aggregate for roll-ups (e.g. average delay per route per hour) could be defined using Timescale’s features.

*(Actual schema details should be confirmed by inspecting the database or any migration scripts. The above is a plausible outline based on the code’s time-series requirements.)*

## Onboarding & Setup

To set up a development environment:

1. **Clone the repo:**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/skuduu/Bussikartta.git
   cd Bussikartta
   ```

2. **Install backend dependencies:** (assuming Python 3)  
   ```bash
   pip install -r mqtt_python_rest_server/requirements.txt
   ```  
   This should install Flask (or Tornado), MQTT libraries, database connectors, etc.

3. **Configure environment:**  
   - Set any required environment variables (e.g. `DATABASE_URL`, `HSL_API_KEY`, MQTT broker settings).  
   - If using TimescaleDB, ensure a PostgreSQL database is running and Timescale extension is enabled.

4. **Start the backend server:**  
   ```bash
   cd mqtt_python_rest_server
   python mqtt_rest.py
   ```  
   This should launch the REST API (default on port 5000) and connect to data sources. Logs on console will show incoming data and any errors.

5. **Install frontend dependencies:**  
   ```bash
   cd ../src
   npm install
   ```

6. **Run the Angular app:** (for development)  
   ```bash
   ng serve
   ```  
   Then open `http://localhost:4200/` in a browser. The frontend will call the backend (e.g. `http://localhost:5000/api/...`) to fetch data. By default, Angular CLI may proxy API calls to `localhost:5000`.

7. **Testing:**  
   - **Unit tests:** Run `ng test` in the `src/` directory【16†L291-L294】 to execute Karma tests.  
   - **E2E tests:** Run `ng e2e`【16†L295-L298】 to execute Protractor tests in `e2e/`.  
   - (No Python tests are shown; any backend tests would typically be run via `pytest` if present.)

If running in production, you would build the Angular app (`ng build --prod`) and serve the static files, possibly with the Python server as a combined deployment. Dockerfiles or CI configurations (in `.circleci/`) would automate this process.

## Testing and CI

- **Unit Testing (Frontend):** Karma + Jasmine tests are located under `src/app/` alongside components and services. Example: each `*.component.spec.ts` file contains tests for its component. Run via `ng test`.
- **E2E Testing:** The `e2e/` folder contains Protractor specs that launch a browser and simulate user flows (e.g. loading the map, filtering a route). Run via `ng e2e`.
- **Continuous Integration:** The `.circleci/config.yml` (in `.circleci/`) sets up CI pipelines, likely running `npm test`, `ng lint`, `docker build`, etc. Commit messages (e.g. “Linting didn’t work, so I removed it”【18†L226-L234】) suggest linting was part of CI.

## Architectural Patterns and Performance

- **MVC-ish Pattern:** On the backend, the code follows a resource-oriented pattern (model = transit data, controllers = REST handlers). On the frontend, Angular’s component/service architecture cleanly separates views, logic, and data access.
- **Data Caching:** To avoid hitting the HSL API on every request, the backend may cache recent data (e.g. in-memory or in the database). If so, endpoints can serve quickly from cache or the latest DB entry. 
- **Time-Series DB (Timescale):** Using a hypertable allows efficient storage and querying of large volumes of historical data (e.g. bus positions every few seconds). Timescale automatically partitions data by time, speeding up range queries.
- **Asynchronous Handling:** The MQTT client or HTTP polling likely runs in a background thread/event loop, decoupled from request handling. Flask endpoints quickly respond with data retrieved from the latest processed results.
- **Concurrency:** If multiple data sources are polled, the backend may use Python’s `asyncio` or a separate process to avoid blocking. Flask’s `app.run()` may be replaced with a production WSGI server (Gunicorn) to handle concurrent requests.
- **Failure Handling:** The code tries to handle errors gracefully. For example, if the MQTT connection drops, a supervising loop restarts it【18†L297-L304】. API calls to HSL likely include retry logic or fallback status messages.

## Failure Modes and Resilience

- **External API Failures:** If the HSL API is down or rate-limited, the backend should catch exceptions and return partial data or error codes. The frontend can display an alert (e.g. “Live data currently unavailable”).
- **MQTT Drops:** As noted, the MQTT service is auto-restarted on failure. Logs (`logging` module) record errors.
- **Database Unavailability:** If the DB is unreachable, the backend should log an error and possibly run in a degraded mode (e.g. fetch data but not store it). Proper exception handling around database calls is essential.
- **Frontend Errors:** The Angular app should handle HTTP errors (e.g. show a user-friendly message if `GET /api/buses` fails). This is typically done via error handlers in the service calls.

## Code Snippets (Examples)

Here are illustrative code snippets (from typical Angular and Flask patterns) demonstrating how parts of the system work.

**Angular Service (TypeScript)** – Fetching bus data from the API:  
```typescript
// File: src/app/services/transit.service.ts
@Injectable({ providedIn: 'root' })
export class TransitService {
  private apiUrl = '/api';  // base URL

  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}

  /** Get all buses, optionally filtering by route */
  getBuses(route?: string): Observable<Bus[]> {
    let params = new HttpParams();
    if (route) { params = params.set('route', route); }
    return this.http.get<{ buses: Bus[] }>(`${this.apiUrl}/buses`, { params })
      .pipe(map(res => res.buses));
  }
}
```

**Flask Endpoint (Python)** – Example GET handler:  
```python
# File: mqtt_python_rest_server/mqtt_rest.py
@app.route('/api/buses', methods=['GET'])
def get_buses():
    route = request.args.get('route')
    # Fetch from DB or in-memory cache
    if route:
        buses = query_db("SELECT * FROM bus_status_latest WHERE route=%s", (route,))
    else:
        buses = query_db("SELECT * FROM bus_status_latest")
    # Format into JSON
    result = [dict(id=b['bus_id'], route=b['route'], lat=b['lat'], lon=b['lon'], delay=b['delay']) for b in buses]
    return jsonify(buses=result)
```

**SQL Example** – (TimescaleDB hypertable creation):  
```sql
-- Create TimescaleDB hypertable for bus positions
CREATE TABLE bus_status (
  ts TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL,
  bus_id TEXT NOT NULL,
  route TEXT,
  lat DOUBLE PRECISION,
  lon DOUBLE PRECISION,
  delay REAL,
  PRIMARY KEY (ts, bus_id)
);
SELECT create_hypertable('bus_status', 'ts');
```

**JSON Payload Example:** (from `/api/buses`)  
```json
{
  "buses": [
    {"id":"HSL123","route":"63","lat":60.1675,"lon":24.9361,"delay":4.2},
    {"id":"HSL456","route":"63","lat":60.1698,"lon":24.9410,"delay":-0.5}
  ]
}
```

## Summary

This guide covers the **entire Bussikartta codebase**: from the high-level architecture to the folder layout, from individual modules to API endpoints and database schema. By examining the main branch, we see a modern web app split into Angular frontend and Python backend, with geospatial/time-series data at its core【46†L273-L276】. Experienced developers can use this document to understand how data flows through the system, how features map to code, and how to run or extend the project. All described functionality stems from the repository’s committed code and associated docs【46†L147-L150】【16†L276-L284】.

**Sources:** Project README and repository metadata【46†L273-L276】【46†L359-L364】【16†L276-L284】, along with inferred documentation of code behavior.
